# Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

A simple calendar application that allows users to save events for each hour of the day. This application runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery. It uses the Day.js library to work with date and time.

## User Story

As an employee with a busy schedule, I want to add important events to a daily planner so that I can manage my time effectively.

## Acceptance Criteria

The app should:

* Display the current day at the top of the calendar when a user opens the planner.
* Present time blocks for standard business hours when the user scrolls down.
* Color-code each time block based on past, present, and future when the time block is viewed.
* Allow a user to enter an event when they click a time block.
* Save the event in local storage when the save button is clicked in that time block.
* Persist events between refreshes of a page.
